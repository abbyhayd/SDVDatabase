# SDVDatabase

## Project Background
This was a quarter long project completed when taking CPSC 3300 (Fundamentals of Database) with Professor Lin Li at Seattle University. I completed this with three other classmates: Alivia Zhao, Kamilla Makhmutova, and Linh Dinh. Created with MySQL, PHP, and HTML. 

## Project Overview
Stardew Valley is a farming simulator game with multiple features such as fishing, mining, and interacting with villagers in the game. The goal of this project was to create an information database that players can use to access information about different items or villagers in the game for a more convenient gameplay. The database contains 8 different tables with information about over 80 items from the game. We created a website that can be used to view items in the database.

## Project Experience
I was in charge of populating the database with information about each item. I also contributed to the web development by helping connect the database to the website. I also gained valuable communication skills by working in a group of other students.
